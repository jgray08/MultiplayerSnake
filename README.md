# MultiplayerSnake
Multiplayer Snake created in C#


Player 1 uses WASD to navigate, player 2 uses the arrow keys.


This is rendered using Console.ForegroundColor and a lot of looping, so it gets glitchy sometimes.

This is my very first C# project and it started as me just messing around trying to draw an image and create "motion"
It eventually spiraled into me wanting to complete my midterm around the idea of ConsoleColor.

Anyways it wont be updated like ever again, but feel free to use it or get inspiration for whatever.
